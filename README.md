  ## Installation

  To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  ```
  npm i
  ```

  ## Usage
  After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, navigate to the repository in the command line and initiate the application using: 
  ```
  node index.js
  ```
  The application will begin prompting the user pokemon type matchups with options for Effective(1x), Super effective(2x), Not very effective(0.5x), and Not effective(0x). As prompts are answered they will be appened to the type_matchup.sql file in sql syntax and once all prompts are answered the sql statement will be ended so the file can be used to seed a database.
